This little modlet provides the ability to modify and add any Text to the KSP loading Screen ToolTips....

Support: For support please refer to the KSP Forum thread. NO LOG = NO SUPPORT.

Install Instructions: Just Install into your GameData folder.

Other Mods: Other Mods can include their own config.ltp in their distributions in the file format below to add their own Mod specific ToolTips.

To Modify ToolTips: Change the included \Plugins\PluginData\Config.ltp file or you can add your own file. For LoadingTipsPlus to pick up your file it must follow these rules: It MUST be somewhere in your GameData folder. It MUST have the file extension ".ltp". It MUST follow this format:

LOADINGTOOLTIPSPLUS { Overwrite = false ToolTip = Tooltips brought to you by LoadingToolTipsPlus... }

You can add as many ToolTip = strings as you like. The Overwrite parameter tells LoadingTipsPlus whether to Replace the Stock ToolTips (set to true) or append your ToolTips to the Stock list (set to false - default).
